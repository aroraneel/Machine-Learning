# Breast Cancer Classification Using Naive Bayes

## Overview
This project uses the **Gaussian Naive Bayes** algorithm to classify breast cancer cases as **Benign** or **Malignant** based on diagnostic features extracted from medical imaging data.  
The notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

## Objective
- Classify breast cancer diagnosis using supervised learning  
- Apply probabilistic classification with Naive Bayes  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix  

---

## Dataset
- **data.csv** (Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset)
- Unnecessary columns (`id`, `Unnamed: 32`) are removed
- Target variable:
  - `diagnosis` (Benign / Malignant)
- Features include:
  - Mean, standard error, and worst-case values of radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension

---

## Data Preparation
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Dropped irrelevant identifier columns
- Selected numerical diagnostic features
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

---

## Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm:** Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- Well-suited for medical classification with continuous features  
- Assumes features follow a normal distribution  

---

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Confusion matrix visualization  

---

## Results
- The Naive Bayes classifier achieves good accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases
- Confusion matrix highlights correct and incorrect predictions
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of probabilistic models in medical diagnosis tasks

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
