# BMW Engine Size Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict the **engine size** of BMW cars based on key numerical features.  
It demonstrates how regression can be used to model relationships in real-world automotive data.

---

## Objective
- Predict engine size using car specifications  
- Apply linear regression on structured vehicle data  
- Evaluate model performance using R² score  

---

## Dataset
- **BMW car dataset**
- Features used:
  - `year`
  - `price`
  - `mileage`
  - `tax`
  - `mpg`
- Target:
  - `engineSize`
- Categorical columns removed during preprocessing

---

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and feature selection using Pandas  
- Train-test split (70% training, 30% testing)  
- Model training using Scikit-learn’s Linear Regression  
- Model evaluation using R² score  

---

## Evaluation Metric
- **R² Score** to measure regression performance  

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn
