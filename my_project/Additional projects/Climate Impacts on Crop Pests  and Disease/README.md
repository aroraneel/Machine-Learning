# Climate-Driven Pest & Disease Impact Analysis in Africa

This project examines how **climate change affects pest pressure, pest performance, and crop yield losses across Africa**.  
Using GAUL administrative boundaries and multiple pest-impact datasets, it identifies **vulnerable crops, high-risk countries, emerging hotspots, and scenario-based differences** under future climate projections.

---

## Objectives
- Identify crops most vulnerable to pests and diseases  
- Analyze country-level pest pressure and emerging hotspots  
- Assess changes in pest impacts between 2040 and 2060  
- Compare climate scenarios (SSP245 vs SSP585)  

---

## Project Structure
The analysis is implemented in a **single Jupyter Notebook** with clearly organized cells:
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing  
- Crop and country-level pest impact analysis  
- Pest performance trend analysis  
- Emerging risk detection (2040 → 2060)  
- Scenario-based comparison and final summaries  

---

## Data Used
- **GAUL administrative boundaries (Africa)**: A0, A1, A2  
- **Pest yield impact (%)** datasets (crop-level losses)  
- **Pest performance (%)** datasets (pest survival and spread)  
- Multiple countries, crops, climate models, and time periods  

---

## Methods
- Data cleaning, normalization, and categorical encoding  
- Aggregation by crop, country, time, and scenario  
- Trend and change analysis (2040 → 2060)  
- Scenario comparison (SSP245 vs SSP585)  

---

## Key Findings
- Pest pressure increases across most regions of Africa  
- Several staple crops show worsening impacts by 2060  
- SSP585 consistently results in higher impacts than SSP245  
- Certain countries emerge as high-risk pest hotspots

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
