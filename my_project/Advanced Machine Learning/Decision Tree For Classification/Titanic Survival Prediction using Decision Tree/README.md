# Titanic Survival Prediction using Decision Tree

## Overview
This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.  
The model is trained on a simple feature to demonstrate how decision trees split data and make classification decisions, along with visualizing the tree structure.

---

## Objective
- Build a basic classification model using Decision Trees  
- Understand how decision trees split data  
- Visualize the trained decision tree  
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics  

---

## Dataset
- **gender_submission.csv** (Titanic dataset)
- Features used:
  - `PassengerId`
- Target variable:
  - `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## Methodology
- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Check dataset shape and missing values  
- Select input feature and target variable  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier with:
  - `max_depth = 4`
- Visualize the trained decision tree  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification report  

---

## Visualization
- Decision Tree plot showing splits and class predictions  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
