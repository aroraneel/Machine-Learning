# Student Performance Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict student performance based on study-related factors.  
The model learns how academic habits influence the final **Performance Index**.

---

## Objective
- Predict student performance using regression  
- Understand the impact of multiple study features  
- Evaluate model performance using R² score  

---

## Dataset
- Student Performance dataset (CSV)
- Features:
  - Hours Studied
  - Previous Scores
  - Sleep Hours
  - Sample Question Papers Practiced
- Target:
  - Performance Index

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Removed non-required column (`Extracurricular Activities`)
- Selected relevant numerical features
- Split data into training and testing sets

---

## Model & Evaluation
- Algorithm: **Linear Regression**
- Train-test split: 70% / 30%
- Evaluation metric: **R² Score**

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn
